                           Respect and trust are the foundation that creates open and honest communication for ideas and efforts. 
                            We don’t have to agree on all things or people, but we must respect them. </p>

                        <p>We should expect loyalty in the team and organization. Not in some fanatical sense, 
                          but in the spirit of being there for your fellow person. Things don’t always go well or as planned.  
                          We should be there for each other in both work and life. Every person has their own set of goals, hopes, and dreams. 
                          As Leaders, it’s our responsibility to pay attention to what is not going well, help, rally, and focus everyone.  
                          Without a sense of loyalty, purpose, and trust, people will not come together in times of need or work. </p>

                        <div className="subheading mb-3">Let others shine</div>
                        <p>Humility allows for trust and loyalty. 
                          Being genuine and respectful starts us on the path of inclusion and openness but humility grows it and feeds it.   
There will be successes some big and some small. We should celebrate them together. 
We should celebrate our successes and the overall organization’s success. 
Don’t fear failure....it's going to happen. DO not fear replicating yourself... it is powerful for all.  
Allowing others to shine and grow is the top reward and a key indicator of a functioning team. </p>

                        <p>Business and life can be a sea of competing needs and goals. 
                          It’s easy to get lost into a web of activities and priorities. 
                          Staying focused on what truly matters is the number one enabler of meaningful progress.  
                          It’s also can be the hardest thing to do.  
                          Only with trust, respect, and humility can we come together to sort out the chaff from the wheat. 
                          Staying focused correctly allows for everyone to participate, achieve, and succeed.  
                          Achieving and accomplishing is the ultimate motivator </p>
